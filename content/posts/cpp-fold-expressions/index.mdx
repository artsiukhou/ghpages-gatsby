Let's write a function that helps us to print debug our code. The function takes another function and its set of parameters as arguments, prints all the arguments and invokes the passed function.

In Python, it would be as simple as (let's forget for a second about decorators, kwargs and so on):

```python
def debugger(func, *args):
    print(*args)
    func(args)
```

But how are you going to do this in C++?

Luckily, we've got [variadic templates](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/parameter_pack) with the C++11 standard. I have used it multiple times (though still googling where to put this `...`), so I know that it's relatively easy to *proxy* arguments (assuming we have all the includes and `using`s:

```cpp
void func1(int x) {
    cout << "invoked func1(int): " << x << endl;
}

void func2(int x, int y) {
    cout << "invoked func2(int, int): " << x << " " << y << endl;
}

void func3(double x, int y) {
    cout << "invoked func3(double, int): " << x << " " << y << endl;
}

void func4() {
    cout << "invoked func4()" << endl;
}

template <typename Func, typename ...Args>
void debugger(Func&& f, Args&&... args) {
    f(forward<Args>(args)...);
}

int main()
{
    debugger(func1, 1);
    // printed: "invoked func1(int): 1"
    debugger(func2, 1, 2);
    // printed: "invoked func2(int, int): 1 2"
    debugger(func3, 1.4, 2);
    // printed: "invoked func3(double, int): 1.4 2"
    debugger(func4);
    // printed: "invoked func4()"
    return 0;
}
```

Ok, but how to print the arguments?

The same webpage about variadic templates actually provides an example with *brace-enclosed initializers*, so our `debugger` can look like this*:*

```cpp
template <typename Func, typename ...Args>
void debugger(Func&& f, Args&&... args) {
    int dummy[sizeof...(Args)] = { (cout << args << " ", 0)... };
    if (sizeof...(Args) != 0) {
        cout << endl;
    }
    f(forward<Args>(args)...);
}
```

IMO that's not a very nice code â€” it's quite difficult to read and understand such code, also we create some array just to imitate iteration through the `args`.

Okay then, there is another way. We will add another helper function `printer` that prints the first argument and then invokes itself with the rest of the arguments. But to make it work we also need to have a "termination" state, `printer` with no parameters:

```cpp
void printer() {
    cout << endl;
}

template <typename Head, typename ...Tail>
void printer(Head&& h, Tail&&... tail) {
    cout << h << " ";
    printer(tail...);
}
```

So, our updated `debugger2` function has the following form now:

```cpp
template <typename Func, typename ...Args>
void debugger_w_printer(Func&& f, Args&&... args) {
    if (sizeof...(Args) != 0) {
        printer(args...);
    }
    f(forward<Args>(args)...);
}
```

That's all good for the C++11/14. But maybe things are better in the C++17? Well, they are better indeed! To start with, there is [constexpr if](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/if) statement, so we can combine both `printer` functions together:

```cpp
template <typename Head, typename ...Tail>
void printer17(Head&& h, Tail&&... tail) {
    cout << h << " ";
    if constexpr (sizeof...(Tail) != 0) {
        printer17(tail...);
    } else {
        cout << endl;
    }
}

template <typename Func, typename ...Args>
void debugger_w_printer17(Func&& f, Args&&... args) {
    if constexpr (sizeof...(Args) != 0) {
        printer17(args...);
    }
    f(forward<Args>(args)...);
}
```

But we can go further as [fold expressions](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/fold) were added to the C++17! Trying them out:

```cpp
template <typename Func, typename ...Args>
void debugger17(Func&& f, Args&&... args) {
    if constexpr (sizeof...(Args) != 0) {
        ((cout << args << " "), ...);
    }
    f(forward<Args>(args)...);
}
```

We can write expressions which are using variadic templates! Let's join some items (the code is not the best, but just to demonstrate the idea:

```cpp
template <typename ...Args>
string join(Args&&... args) {
    stringstream s;
    ((s << args << ","), ...);
    string result = s.str();
    result.pop_back();
    return result;
}

cout << join("hello") << endl;
cout << join(12, "hello", -45.0, "world") << endl;
```

Or let's add all the arguments to a vector:

```cpp
template <typename T, typename... Args>
void push_all(vector<T>& v, Args&&... args) {
    (v.push_back(args), ...);
}

vector<int> v;
push_all(v, 10, 20, -100, 15);
```

For sure such functions have limited application. But anyway, this looks quite cool and it's useful to remember about that feature, so when the time comes you'll be ready to use it.

As usual, you can find all the code from the post on [GitHub](https://github.com/artsiukhou/blog_examples/tree/main/variadic-templates-and-fold-expressions).
